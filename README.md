# LightWork
## About the project
LightWork is a web app that allows you to keep track of your workouts created using the Spring Boot framework for the backend and Angular for the front end of the application! The apps allows the user to add and view his workouts in a user friendly environment. The data is stored in a local H2 database. The reason i created this project is in order to better understand the usage of Springboot for the developement of API Services and the flexibility that a framework such as Angular has to provide for the frontend.
